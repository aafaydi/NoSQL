# NoSQL
 NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API

Description:
 Your challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js (Links to an external site.) and Mongoose (Links to an external site.) packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

# Acceptance Criteria:
When you enter the command to invoke the application then the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.

Testing API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts return the data for each of these routes in a formatted JSON

Testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core are able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts

Testing API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core are able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list.
